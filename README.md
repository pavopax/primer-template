# Primer Template

A template for a simple GitHub pages website using the Primer theme.

# Demo

See what this looks like at [pavopax.github.io/primer-template/](https://pavopax.github.io/primer-template/)

# Get started

Create the simplest GitHub pages site possible:

1) Create content:

  * Create a new repository on GitHub (Enterprise is ok)
  * Add a README.md file with some content into the repository

2) Publish so others can see it:

  * Go to repository `Settings` (tab on top right) - scroll down to `GitHub
    Pages` and in `Source` select `master branch`
  * The page will refresh. Scroll down again to `GitHub Pages` and find the
    link to your GitHub Page under "Your site is published at ..".
  * Open the link to view your website
  * You can now share that link!

That's it!

# Update content

  * For a single page, README.md works fine.
  * For multiple pages, consider renaming `README.md` to `index.md`

For a more robust template, you can clone this repository as a starting point,
see "Extensions".
